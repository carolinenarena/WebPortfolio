# WebPortfolio

These commits are a very early look at my design for my web portfolio. I have the main layout of my site created, with a navigation bar including the different pages and what I want to include on each page.  I have the images I want to use, one of myself for the front page, and an image of my resume which will be put on the experience page. All of thr pages will follow the same format as the home page which will just include my image and a short bio.  All of the pages will be simplistic and have a banner at the top with the title.  I havent decided on whether I want to keep the colors white gray, and black yet.  Overall, I want to create a simple and really professional look for my web portfolio.  I also want to be simple in my design so the site is super easy to navigate. Although the web portfolio has a long way to go, the main features and design ideas have been implemented.
